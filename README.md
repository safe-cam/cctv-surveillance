## Features

- User roles: **Admin** and **Customer**  
  - Admin: add/view customers, manage accounts, view statistics; **cannot** access camera feeds or private detection content.  
  - Customer: access real-time camera/webcam feeds, upload image/video for detection, view detection history, change password, manage profile.  
- Plan-based limits (e.g. Basic, Standard, Premium) ‚Üí controls how many cameras, features accessible, etc.  
- Real-time webcam feed using WebRTC / similar technology.  
- Detection on images/videos/uploads + in real time: faces, objects, persons, pets, accidents, violence, gun detection, sound alerts (gunshots, screams), license plate detection, helmet detection, vehicle color recognition, speed detection, no-parking zone monitoring, thermal imaging (if supported).  
- Wanted face / wanted license plate: upload wanted items, preview, and match.  
- Annotated outputs + matching text/messages.  
- Detection history: searchable, filterable, with stored data (images, dates, types, etc.).

## Architecture

A high level view of how components interact:

```

\[ Frontend (Web) ] <--> \[ Backend API (Flask / Streamlit) ] <---> \[ Detection Models / Microservices ]
\|                     |                               &#x20;
\|                     |                                 -> \[ Storage (images/videos) ]
\|                     |
\|                     -> \[ Authentication & Authorization ]
|
-> WebRTC / streaming for real-time feed

````

- **Authentication & Authorization** handled via backend, role-based access.  
- **MongoDB** (or similar NoSQL DB) for user data, detection history, wanted items, etc.  
- Separate storage for:  
  - Admin/customer accounts  
  - Detection history + metadata + media files (images/videos)  
- Models for detection either bundled or via separate microservices / modules.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology / Framework |
|---|---|
| Backend framework | Fast API (or Streamlit for some dashboards) |
| Database | MongoDB |
| Real-time feed | WebRTC or similar streaming mechanism |
| Detection / ML Models | DeepFace, OpenCV, pretrained models for object detection, custom sound event detection etc. |
| Frontend | HTML / CSS / JavaScript (lightweight), templates or React/Vue if extended |
| Storage | Local filesystem or cloud storage (S3 or equivalent) for media outputs |
| Authentication | JWT or session tokens, password hashing etc. |

---

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- pip / virtualenv  
- MongoDB instance running (local or remote)  
- (Optional) GPU / CUDA if using heavy detection models  
- (Optional) Dependencies for sound detection, webcam, etc.

### Clone & Environment Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/safe-cam/cctv-surveillance.git
cd cctv-surveillance
````

Create a virtual environment, activate it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Create a configuration file (e.g. `.env` or config file) with the following (example) environment variables:

```text
# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cctv_surveillance

# Detection models paths
MODEL_FACE_PATH=path/to/face_model
MODEL_VEHICLE_PATH=path/to/vehicle_model

# Storage paths
MEDIA_UPLOAD_FOLDER=/path/to/uploads
MEDIA_OUTPUT_FOLDER=/path/to/annotated_outputs

```

### Running the Application

First, ensure MongoDB is running. Then:

```bash
# fast api
uvicorn main:app --reload

# OR, use CLI
fastapi dev main.py

# For serving real-time video / WebRTC, ensure correct webcams / RTSP streams are configured
```

(Optional) For development mode with hot reload, debugging:

```bash
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

---

## Usage

* **Register / Login** as admin or customer.
* Admin can add customers, assign plans.
* Customer can connect camera(s), or upload images/videos for detection.
* Use the UI to view real-time streams (if applicable), and see detection annotations.
* View detection history, filter by date, type, etc.
* Manage ‚Äúwanted‚Äù faces / plates: upload images, description; system tries matching if detection triggers.

---

## Database Schema (Collections / Models)

Here‚Äôs a suggested schema if using MongoDB:

* `users`

  ```json
  {
    _id: ObjectId,
    username: string,
    email: string,
    password_hash: string,
    role: "admin" | "customer",
    profile_photo_url: string,
    plan: "basic" | "standard" | "premium",
    camera_limit: number,
    created_at: datetime,
    updated_at: datetime
  }
  ```

* `cameras`

  ```json
  {
    _id: ObjectId,
    user_id: ObjectId, 
    camera_name: string,
    stream_url / device_info: string,
    is_active: boolean,
    created_at: datetime
  }
  ```

* `detection_history`

  ```json
  {
    _id: ObjectId,
    user_id: ObjectId,
    camera_id: ObjectId (optional, for real-time feed),
    upload_type: "image" | "video" | "webcam",
    detection_type: string,  // e.g. ‚Äúface‚Äù, ‚Äúaccident‚Äù, etc.
    result_annotation_path: string,  // where the output image/video with boxes etc is stored
    message: string, // e.g. ‚ÄúWanted face matched‚Äù, etc.
    timestamp: datetime,
    raw_input_path: string,  // original file or stream snapshot if needed
  }
  ```

* `wanted_faces`

  ```json
  {
    _id: ObjectId,
    description: string,
    image_path: string,
    user_uploaded_by: ObjectId,
    created_at: datetime
  }
  ```

* `wanted_plates`

  ```json
  {
    _id: ObjectId,
    plate_number: string,
    image_path: string,
    description: string,
    user_uploaded_by: ObjectId,
    created_at: datetime
  }
  ```

* `plans` (optional, if dynamic)

  ```json
  {
    _id: ObjectId,
    name: "basic" | "standard" | "premium",
    camera_limit: integer,
    features: [ string ],  // list of detection types enabled
    price: number
  }
  ```
